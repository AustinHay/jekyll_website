Branch Podcasts | Mobile Strategy
===================================

### Introduction ###

In order to help Branch become a leader in everything the mobile, deeplinking, native app ecosystem, I think it would be a great idea to start publishing podcasts on mobile. A first step in this direction is to answer some of the tough questions that have been asked by industry thought leaders. A frequently cited podcast on deeplinking and mobile involves a talk between Balaji S., Chris Dixon and Benedict Evans in which they discuss the fact that a mobile pagerank really doesn't exist and where the future of native vs. mobile apps might be headed. We might not be able to answer all of these questions, but it would be awesome to get a discussion going.

I've typed up executive notes on the podcast along with some killer questions that I'd love to sit down and discuss for our first podcast. 

Let me know when we can plan this.

### Killer Questions on Mobile &amp; Deeplinking ###

* Why isn't there a better way to search for apps on the app stores -- both for Android and iOS?

* Is this a universal developer pain point? Why?

* How do you think Branch is going to help native apps evolve out of the pre-page rank era of mobile?

* How do Branch links help users find, explore and interact with app content better?

* Why is deeplinking so much more than just the links?

* How do you think deeplinking and Branch answer this problem" "You don't have a universal resource locator for every single piece of content with apps."

* Do you think Apple is going to kill native apps?

* Do you think native apps are going to die off in the same way that desktop software has?

* Do you think deeplinking through the app store and deeplinking app content really fades into the background when you think about mobile interaction from a very high level? How does Branch links fit into this ecosystem?


### Original Podcast Notes: ###

* Pre-Page Rank Era of Mobile
* When you look at the app store today it's like looking at Yahoo in 1995
* No way to find the right things you want to use on the device
* App stores are like Amazon -- list everything that exists, but not way to discover and explore this
* Pre-NetScape Phase as well: things are happening outside of the browser
* How to we find, explore, and interact with content.
* There's the app, webapp, card, url, messaging app etc. but it's not yet well defined how to find the content you're looking for and on the dev side, how you explore engage customers within that
* Chris Dixon: Nobody has invented the real page rank for mobile yet.
* No HTML for native -- no deeplinking through content, no analygous linking structure that you see on the web
* You don't have a universal resource locator for every single piece of content with apps
* Even if you deeplink to content you still have to have the app
* The reason we had the web is because it was impossibly difficult to do anything else -- it was too hard to get people to buy the desktop software
* Smartphones are communications platforms that desktops never were 
* The smartphone itself becomes the social platform -- the device itself is the platform
* Not limited to the browser... you can do all other sorts of things
* Pulling away from native apps (Apple with health/cards)
* URX Mentioned at 5:30
* URX is doing deeplinking
* An app is a view on top of an underlying data store
* Urbit -- web links between pages... but how should we link between apps?
* We shouldn't really have to document an API for every app by utilizing the internal directory structure on the local phone
* Phones as a distributed data center
* Links between applications based on data interces 
* Large caches of local data -- inversion of today's model of access
* Apple runs a full stack with integration based on fingerprinting, wireless, bluetooth etc.
* Google is trying to the opposite -- lifting all its services into the cloud.
* Language and player is less important than the mobile interaction -- what will the icon on your homescreen look like, how did it get there?, did it appear automatically?, are there downnloads, is it geo-traced?
* Deeplinking into apps fades away in this context
* Who is it that is going to kill the native app? Apple.
* Google might try, but Apple will be the one who turns around and changes the infrastructure and platform.
