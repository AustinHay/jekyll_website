### Introduction: ###

Branch engages on many active channels throughout social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, and, most recently, Soundcloud. It's important to know that there are best practices when posting on these channels. We should encourage every team member to post content, but we should have a unified and consistent approach with guide-lines for how we message and brand ourselves. 

### Basic Content Rules of the Road: ###

* Make sure all your posts have <b>attached, relevant link, and preferably embedded open graph tags</b>. Most important to this is the og-image tag which will make the content you embed more interesting since on bigger channels, like FB, and Twitter, it will display and image along with whatever content you're messaging.

* <b>Think of relevant and consistent tags</b> to use across our channels so that we start to build up a large base of tags that are associated with our Branch name and brand. Here are some good ones to start with:

   - deeplinking
   - mobile
   - growth
   - software
   - appdev
   - growthhacking

As we think of more we should keep a marketing list that we refer to so that we use consistent tags all the time. If we keep using different tags then we will never really grow a consistent tag index associated with the Branch name.

* <b>Never start a post with "Check out ..."</b> This is one of the fatal flaws of marketing. The phrase is widely over-used and should be avoided at all costs. Many publishers talk about the notion that nobody is going to "check out" something just because you are asking them to do it -- save friends and family who might just love you enough to click a link because you tell them to. No, in reality you have to drive the audience to your content purposefully.  You need to rope them in with something interesting, exciting, and fun. Play to their curiosity. Think about which channel you're going after and then craft your statement to spark interest in somebody that fits that type.

* When <b>boosting</b> advertised media on Facebook and Twitter, <b>focus on audience</b>3. Who is going to benefit the most from this content and in turn share it with friends? What factors can we select for in our targetted outreach to make sure the content is delivered to them? Like Morgan Brown mentioned, don't be afraid to run tests if you're not sure. Try a few different outreach strategies and see which one works the best. Then, document your success and share it with the marketing team so that we aren't running tests aimlessly.
