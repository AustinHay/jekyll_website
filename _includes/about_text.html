<p>Hi. My name is Austin. I'm an engineer, newly-devoted coder, blogger, and business development strategist. I work at <a href="http://branch.io">Branch Metrics</a> in Palo Alto, CA. </p>

<p>I like things at the intersect of software, strategy, technology, business intelligence, operations, leadership, finance, product development, and social entrepreneurship. I've had experience in many industries, but my favorite work has been in social impact ventures in developing countries, startups, and non-profits. I'm also fascinated with improving corporate success &amp; growth as a function of executive well-being and personal development.</p>

<p>Before I worked at Accenture, I analyzed the growth of nascent markets and how emerging technology companies compete in developing sectors, including quantitative fitness, mobile payments, electric vehicles, and genetic engineering. I also closely studied and wrote on the strategies by which millenial leaders create social and economic impact. 

<p>In the past, I've worked in <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/austinahay/">various operational and leadership roles</a> at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://www.collegespring.com">College Spring</a>, <a href="http://www.ohmygreen.com/">Oh My Green!</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/paloalto/">Apple</a>, and as both research and teaching assistants while studying at Stanford. 

<p>Since that time, my experiences in engineering, business, WASH and product development have taken me to China, India, Japan, Cambodia, Guam, and Palau. I'm always looking for new and exciting opportunities to grow.
