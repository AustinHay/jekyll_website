I write on here and with Branch Metrics. This is as [posted](https://blog.branch.io/the-developer-experience-and-goats/) via the Branch [Blog](https://blog.branch.io)


We have a simple mantra here at Branch: Made by developers, for developers. It's the essence of our [product](https://branch.io/links?bmp=dmitri_podcast) and approach. Nobody at Branch lives it more, than our CTO and cofounder, [Dmitri Gaskin](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mll45kfhf/dmitri-gaskin-19/?bmp=dmitri_podcast).

But... Dmitri isn't your average CTO. In fact, there are few others in the world like him. At 19, Dmitri is an unequivocal master coder and technologist, a [Forbes 30-under-30](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mll45kfhf/dmitri-gaskin-19/?bmp=dmitri_podcast), a trained shepherd who raises his own goats, a fromager, and a professional accordionist. And for somebody with so many unique talents, Dmitri not only has an incredible story, but some of the greatest advice out there on building tech products and focusing on the developer experience.

We feel lucky to have Dmitri with us everday and felt obligated to share some of his great wisdom, and humor, with the world. This is one podcast you will not want to skip.
