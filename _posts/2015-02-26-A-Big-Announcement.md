The recent [announcement of our Series A](http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/branch-metrics-raises-15-million-for-its-smarter-mobile-deep-linking-technology/) has been received with overwhelming support! I wrote about it in greater detail over on [Branch](https://blog.branch.io/where-branch-is-headed/).

Besides our announcement, lots of people have asked us a simple question: How did Branch get started?

In another podcast with Branch Metrics, I sit down with the co-founding team at Branch Metrics to answer this question and talk about the future of both Branch and mobile deeplinking.
