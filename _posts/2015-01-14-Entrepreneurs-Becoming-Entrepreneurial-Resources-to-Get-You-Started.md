I am not an entrepreneur. I think the word, at one point in the past, had a unique and meaningful place in the language of US business jargon. But now it's become too out of touch with what it's intended to represent.

Entrepreneurs were those contrarian individuals with grit, determination, clever ideas, and a wacky sense of world paradigms that allowed them to create new, interesting, and risky initiatives that drove measurable change.

I think [Ben Horowitz](http://www.bhorowitz.com/) does a good job of defining the scope of a real entrepeneur. Okay, seriously though, read "[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-ben-horowitzs-honest-and-real-take-on-entrepreneurship/)". I agree that if you haven't woken up in the night with a cold sweat worrying about the fudiciary responsibility owed to your [lieutenants](https://about.usc.edu/presidentemeritus/contrarians-guide-to-leadership/) then you probably can't claim ownership of the word. This is why I am not an entrepreneur -- although, one day with a bit of luck and boatload of hard work, I hope to be distinguished enough to reach that pinnacle of impact.

 That's not to say there still aren't a lot of awesome entrepreneurs out there, but the world of technology and computing has led every smart 20+ year old with a knack for app development, or every business major with a creative idea to claim the title and set off on a destruction course. Are you shocked? You shouldn't be.

[Having a cool idea](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html) doesn't make you an entrepreneur. Failing doesn't [always](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/business/wearing-your-failures-on-your-sleeve.html) make you an entrepreneur. Raising money from hungry VC's also doesn't make you an entrepreneur. But there are plenty of things in the world that make you entrpreneurial. 

What most people don't understand or realize is that the qualities that make entrepreneurs great should be separated from the word that has now become vastly over-used. This is one of the great lessons I took away from [Tom Byers](https://profiles.stanford.edu/thomas-byers) and his legendary course on "[Entrepreneurial Finance &amp; Management](http://stvp.stanford.edu/about/)".

So, what does it mean to be *entrepreneurial*? I am not in a position of supreme authority to shed much light, but I do have an opinion that I believe in: true entrepreneurship and genuine leadership are inherently tied together. 

Entrepreneurs, and great leaders, know what matters most. They understand charisma, empathy, and are devoted to self-development. They reflect, improve, fail, and repeat the process in an effort to become better people -- which in turns allows them to better lead those they serve. And that's a key distinction that can't be forgotten. 

*Good leaders recognize that they are acting as servants and stewards to others.* Similarly, good entrepreneurs, real entrepreneurs are "in it" for the impact. This isn't always the case, but it should be and among [the entrepreneurs I admire the most](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/09/18/talking-philanthropy-with-marc-benioff/), it most certainly is true. 

Beyond the soft contours of entrepreneurship that I have described, there is also a technical skillset that begets those who practice entrepreneurship. In my mind, this isn't just software development or computer science. *You don't have to be a coder or programmer*, but analytical prowess and a fascination with math, science, finance, businessn, strategy, and product development are certainly some popular pillars. 

If you're like me, you're probably thinking "this is great and all, but what next." Not everyone has time to dedicate themselves to the study of these diverse fields, and even if you did, starting can be complicated. 

What matters more, however, is that anyone -- you, me, your younger sister, your older manager, she, he, or them -- *anyone* can become more entrepreneurial, can practice entrepreneurship and therein become a better leader and person, by committing themselves to learning and growing. Boom: [Growth Mindset 101](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/business/06unbox.html).

That's really the power of entrepreneurship. And to get you started, I've assembled a list of my favorite reads on just this. Many kudos to the mentors &amp; advisors who have helped me with these wonderful resources.
