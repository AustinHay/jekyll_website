An exciting career first happened earlier this week: I conducted my [first podcast](https://soundcloud.com/branchmetrics). It seems trivial, but in fact, podcasting is not only a great way to learn, but a great way to dive into a company's culture and help produce interesting, useful content. It's also [growing](http://digiday.com/platforms/podcasts-5-chars/) in popularity at an insanely fast rate...

In this first podcast, where I interview Branch CEO [Alex Austin](https://medium.com/@alexaustin/just-keep-building-ca1e43df8e5a), we discuss mobile &amp; deeplinking. What's funny is that the podcast was an immense edification tool for myself; I hope it continues to serve this purpose not only for all the new partners and developers we work with, but also for incoming Branch employees.
