When I set out to learn to code last year, I had no real understanding of how simple web-development languages might increase my productivity and efficiency in my daily routine. In all honesty, I was just eager to learn more of what was going on under the hood of my computer. But as an engineer and somebody with a background and love of technology, I actually believed that I was maxing out my returns on my existing computer knowledge. In hindsight, I could not have been more wrong. Learning to code over the last several months has empowered me not only to develop a new career trajectory, but to excel as a business operator. It's allowed me to do things faster, better, and more efficiently.

For me, coding has taken many forms, but one element -- scripting -- has proven to be the gold-mine of skill-building. [Scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) is fundamentally the process of automating and executing tasks that, alternatively, would have to be performed by hand. Think of how many things you do manually every day. Setting up those meeting notes? Scheduling those emails? Transferring small tidbits of data from one excel sheet to another. Sometimes these are essential details of any role. But wouldn't it be great to invest some additional time upfront to never have to worry about it again. 

 Scripting is awesome because it allows you to do this! It lets you take new or existing knowledge of any computer language and build robust tasks that automate the things you spend countless hours on every week. What's more important is that scripting is not just a great tool for coders -- it's an essential skill for business people, students, blue-collars, white-collars, artists, professors, parents and anyone else who uses a computer to do their daily work. 

Some of these [high-level biz ops tasks](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/How-to-Save-Time-and-Money-using-Scripting-Technology) can be identified easily. But really, you should be thinking about how learning computer programming -- and therein investing many upfront hours -- can actually increase your performance at work, improve your time flexibility, and cut away the mundane tasks that you might encounter. 

To further this picture, let me give you some examples of how I have used scripting to improve my work flow and become a more efficient operator.

Case 1: Personal Use -- A Simple Script to Randomly Select and Move Photos

This first case is a personal script I wrote to help randomly select background photos from a huge repository and move them to my blog's image asset repository. Why did I need to develop a script for this? Because I have a huge database of over 1000 photos that I want to cycle through for my blog. Everytime I pushed changes to my website, I would go through and stare at all 1000+ photos in a tiny folder on my Mac. The chances of me changing these photos intelligently are quite low.

So after doing this task by hand for a while, I finally decided to build a small script that operated in this way:

1.) Go to my background-images repository.
2.) Fetch 10 unique, random, non-repeating images.
3.) Rename them to fit my CSS tags.
4.) Copy and move them to my website image assets folder.

The script was actually very easy to build. You see, the thing about high-level languages today is that there are incredible libraries that support the work you're doing. For Ruby, there is a ```fileutils gem``` that allows you to operate command line functions from a script. You can even add ```chmod``` characterization and run it as a ```shell script```. In essence, this allows you to create double-click functions that perform WHATEVER YOU WANT!!!

Okay, you still don't believe me? Let's check out another case study in my professional work.

Case 2: Professional Use -- Another Simple Script to Create On-Demand Meeting Note Templates

In my role as an analyst at Accenture I have to take a lot of notes. I am constantly meeting with the client to gather data and insights about the project at hand. In order to make things easier

Two case studies of how scripting has impacted my efficiency at work.
Developing a coder mindset -- is there something you do frequently, every day or every week that can be automated?
It may not seem like you'll save that much time, but 5 minutes every week adds up fast.
