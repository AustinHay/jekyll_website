Recently, I wrote a critical response to the "Failed promise of deeplinks," by Scott Rosenberg. You can and should read [his full response](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-failed-promise-of-deep-links-aa307b3abaa5). Then, when you're ready to hear why there were some disagreements on my end, you should explore [my response](https://medium.com/@AustinHay/hi-scott-8fd0e4584347). Everything here is host on Medium.
