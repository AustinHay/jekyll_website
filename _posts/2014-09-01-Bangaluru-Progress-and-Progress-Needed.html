<p>Maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised when I got to India. There is a noticeable technology presence in this city, known for its gathering of the world's biggest players in IT services, but poverty is still woven into the fabric of Bangalore <!--more--> -- as is the case with so many places in India. It was eye-opening to contrast the stories I have heard of India's rapid rise with the reality of its struggle. Trash lines the streets, cars overwhelm the city's transportation system, and people are in constant motion. The massive exodus of Indian peoples from rural to urban centers, like Bangalore, has stressed the infrastructure. I have never seen so clearly the need for improved sanitation and human health. Some of the water and WASH problems noticeable here were prevalent in Cambodia when I visited last spring as well.</p>

<p>Bangalore is very much a city of progress and of progress needed. </p>
